## SAP BPC Organisation Report Generator 

I have developed a script using Python to generate the Organization Structure for the client and send it out to the user over email (monthly) with a detailed view of the self-designed Pivot view. It collects the data from excel and analyzes and reshapes the data as we need for the report. The proposed and implemented idea helps us in generating the report as much as we need with less time. The idea behind this innovation is to get the data dump from the active system and upload it to the Python console application. This application can handle a complex data set, and no errors are reported so far after many use. This tool is cost-saving as we donâ€™t need a dedicated person to be occupied for a week to perform this activity
